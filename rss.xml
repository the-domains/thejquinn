            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Woes of set design</h1><p>In the end, we must be faithful to make Jesus the main thing, and seek to put his beauty on display for all to see.  When our hearts are reflecting that vision, and our efforts in line with that vision, these issues fade away into oblivion.  </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d6759019bed113944f5c3bc61f611decee1ab02a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What have I learned?</h1><p>All I ever really wanted to do was to help people feel like I felt at Passion '98.  I walked in the room and the presence of God was in my face.  It brought me to tears instantly, the feeling of pure love.  It was intoxicating.  And when I had the opportunity to do what I do full-time, I was honored, and committed.  And I have strived with all that I have to recreate that feeling.  </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/45c1be7edd0f372a9f8a3536576921aac4b3a83d.jpg"></article>]]></description>
