"where's jesus in this", "the logo is over the top", "I close my eyes and all I see is the logo", etc...</p><p>Ouch.  For some reason, it stung pretty bad.  We were just exploring our creativity, trying to make the environment more worshipful.  Why on earth did people let it distract them so much?  How could we have gotten it so wrong?  </p><p>In the last year, we have added a hazer, and moving lights, we are mixing a little louder, as well.  I understand that we are pushing the production envelope at our church, and this particular stage design tripped the breaker of some people.  It's ok.  We all have our different thresholds of production.  Mine is way up there.  Others, not so much.  </p><p>I actually think that sometimes, we do a pretty poor job of turning consumers into contributors.  Because if you come to church in order to contribute to the expansion of the kingdom, you don't ask yourself, "what did I not like about this service" - and then submit a form.  That makes it all about you.  But, I wonder also if by asking the question on our form, "how can we serve you better", then we have inadvertently perpetuated the consumer mentality of our church?   </p><p>But here is the thing.  Stage design is just a flavor enhancer.  It's just another layer of an already delicious cake.  It's not the main thing.  In fact, it should never be.  In our creative teams heart, it for sure wasn't.  We were just having fun.  But I am realizing, in the chance that we "miss it" with one of our designs, it shouldn't hurt like it did.  And, perhaps a simple pallet wall is all that we need.  Too flashy, people will let you know.  Too plain, they will probably let you know.  Here's a truthful statement.  You can NEVER please everyone, you will fail every time.  </p><p>In the end, we must be faithful to make Jesus the main thing, and seek to put his beauty on display for all to see.  When our hearts are reflecting that vision, and our efforts in line with that vision, these issues fade away into oblivion.  </p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 data-reactid="31"><a data-reactid="32">The View from up Here</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="36"></div></section></div></div>
