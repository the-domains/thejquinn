## What have I learned?

All I ever really wanted to do was to help people feel like I felt at Passion '98\.  I walked in the room and the presence of God was in my face.  It brought me to tears instantly, the feeling of pure love.  It was intoxicating.  And when I had the opportunity to do what I do full-time, I was honored, and committed.  And I have strived with all that I have to recreate that feeling.  

But here's the thing.  I can't do anything about that.  It doesn't matter how good of a player I am.  It doesn't matter how young/artistic/creative the band.  There is nothing in my toolbox that can create a moment like that.  However, there are plenty of things in my toolbox that can destroy those moments.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/49b19c62-a4f5-4f85-ab1f-99bf012d3331.JPG)

It's currently Saturday night, my wife is out of town for the next 10 days.  I am somewhat anxious about what those next 10 days will look like, but I am pumped about what tomorrow holds.  Sunday's coming.  I'll be ready.
